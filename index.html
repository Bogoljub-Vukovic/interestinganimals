                <p>Animal Planet is an American basic cable and satellite television channel owned by Discovery Communications. Originally focused on more 
                    educationally-based television shows, the network has featured more reality programming since 2008. It is available throughout the United States,
                    as well as in over 70 countries around the world. Country-specific versions of the channel have been created in Canada, India, Japan, Taiwan, and 
                    other countries. As of January 2016, approximately 91,603,000 households receive Animal Planet.</p>
                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Animal Planet was launched on October 1, 1996; it was created by Discovery Communications in cooperation with the British Broadcasting Corporation.
                    On January 1, 1997, Animal Planet's distribution grew as a result of Advance Entertainment Corporation selling the satellite transponder slot belonging
                    to the WWOR EMI Service (a national superstation feed of Secaucus, New Jersey/New York City's WWOR-TV, that was implemented following the 1989 passage 
                    of the Syndication Exclusivity Rights Rule by the Federal Communications Commission) to Discovery Communications, replacing the feed with Animal Planet 
                    outright. In late 2005, as part of a multimillion-dollar expansion, the National Aquarium in Baltimore opened an exhibit called "Animal Planet Australia:
                    Wild Extreme". Animal Planet and the National Aquarium in Baltimore announced a multi-year partnership the year prior, which produced an original orientation
                    film that gives Aquarium visitors background on the Australian area which inspired the new exhibit and a dedicated area inside the expansion where visitors 
                    can learn about Animal Planet's conservation efforts and other programming. The partnership also allowed the possibility of future productions of television 
                    programs about the National Aquarium in Baltimore's research and exhibits. In 2006, BBC Worldwide sold its 20% interest in the flagship Animal Planet U.S.
                    network back to Discovery Communications.[4] The BBC maintained its 50% ownership in Animal Planet's European, Asian and Latin American channels, as well 
                    as a minority interest in Animal Planet Japan and Animal Planet Canada until November 15, 2010,[5] when BBC Worldwide sold 50% interest in Animal Planet and 
                    Liv to Discovery Communications for $156 million.[6] Animal Planet is additionally an associate member of the Caribbean Cable Cooperative.[7]
                    During the late 2000s, Genius Products announced a U.S. distribution agreement involving Animal Planet and TLC. Jakks Pacific also entered into a 
                    licensing agreement to develop Animal Planet-branded pet products.</p>
                    <h2>Relaunch</h2>
                <p>On February 3, 2008, Animal Planet "relaunched" itself as part of a new branding campaign that "sheds its soft and furry side for programming and an
                    image with more bite."[8] As part of the relaunch, Animal Planet replaced its elephant and spinning globe logo for a starker text image that allows more
                    flexibility in its usage.[9] Eight new shows and specials were scheduled to debut in February of that year, with the new shows aimed at reaching a more 
                    adult audience with programming designed to tap into humans' basic instincts with stories that reiterate what makes humans human</p>
                <p class="citat"> The goal is to move from being perceived by viewers as paternalistic, preachy, and observation-based to being seen as active,
                     entertaining and edgy. That means targeting adults 25-49, rather than full families, with less voice-of-God narration and more visceral imagery and 
                     sounds. Think of it as swapping a drab narrator saying that a lion is about to kill its prey for the blood-curdling scream of the doomed creature 
                     as it meets its demise.</p>
                <p class="autorCitat">— Anne Becker, Broadcasting & Cable</p>
                <p>This rebranding effort continued in 2010 with a change of the network's slogan, from "Same Planet, Different World" to "Surprisingly Human" to coincide
                    with their non-animal related programming</p>
                <h2>Programming</h2>
                <p>Recent additions to the channel, such as Meerkat Manor and Orangutan Island, reflect its shift toward "predation programming" and more immersive
                    storytelling. Animal Planet intended the new direction to help revitalize stagnating ratings, after primetime viewership of the network dropped by 9% 
                    in 2007.[11] Animal Planet added pseudo-scientific documentary, reality television, and sitcom shows to its line-up. Animal Planet is also well known 
                    for its annual stunt program, the Puppy Bowl, a yearly special shown during the afternoon leading up to the NFL's Super Bowl, primarily consisting of 
                    puppies at play; the original commentator was the sports broadcaster Harry Kalas.</p>
